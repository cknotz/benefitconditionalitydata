      <h3> About </h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Many believe that the unemployed are too 'lazy' or 'choosy', and that
          unemployment rates could be lowered if the unemployed would be given more
          'tough love'. Others counter that the unemployed are already treated too
          harshly, and that they should rather receive more help and support. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a long time, though, it was not easy to say exactly how strictly or
        leniently the
        unemployed in a given country were really treated: how freely they could
        choose between available jobs, how stringently their job-search efforts
        were checked, and what penalties could be imposed if they would not comply
        with their obligations. As a result, it was also not fully clear whether
        countries with tough rules really do have lower unemployment rates &mdash; and
        therefore whether putting the unemployed under pressure really is a good
        way to reduce unemployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Comparative Unemployment Benefit Conditions & Sanctions Dataset </strong> was created to solve
        this problem. It provides systematic information and quantitative indicators
        of the strictess of job-search and reporting requirements, the definition of
        'suitable work', and unemployment benefit sanction rules in 21 economically
        advanced democracies in Europe, North America and Australasia
        between 1980 and 2012.
      </p>
      <p class="descr">
        <strong>These data have already provided us with a clearer picture of how strict
          rules for the unemployed are related to the performance of the labor market</strong>.
        The two interactive graphs below show that countries that had in the period
        between 1980 and 2012 required the unemployed to seek work more actively and
        be available for a wider range of jobs tended to have lower unemployment
        rates (graph on the left), but only slightly so. Also visible is that
        countries that had in the same period imposed tougher benefit sanctions
        on the unemployed tended to have higher unemployment rates (graph on the right).

        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047279418000740" target="_blank">here</a>) revealed that putting greater pressure on the unemployed
        to seek and accept work does indeed improve labor market performance; stricter
        sanction rules, on the other hand, are <i> a result of</i> high unemployment:
        Sanction rules tend to be made stricter after economic downturns. But the data
        do not show that stricter sanction rules then have an effect on unemployment rates
        (but they do have other <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047279417000915" target="_blank">

        the Crafoord Foundation (<a href="https://www.crafoord.se" target="_blank">Crafoordska
          stiftelsen</a>) as well as lots of help,
        advice, and support from numerous contributors, country experts, and
        interested scholars. The work on this dataset was conducted at the
        <a href="http://www.svet.lu.se" target="_blank">Department of Political Science</a>
        at Lund University.</p>

        <h3>Directly load the dataset into <code>R</code></h3>
        <p>
          R users can directly import the main dataset or selected subsets of it using a single convenience function, <code>getCondData()</code>. The function itself can also be directly sourced into R:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>library(devtools)</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cknotz/benefitconditionalitydata/master/getCondData.R")</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arguments:</strong> The function has three optional arguments, which are used to subset the data:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>indicators</code>: Selects one or more of the synthetic summary indicators included in the dataset (see also "What the data measure" in the dashboard above or the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5epa4bbdn91xmvd/Knotz.Nelson_ConditionalityData_Codebook.pdf?dl=0">Codebook</a> for further details).

                Carlo worked on the Benefit Conditions & Sanctions Dataset during
                his time as a doctoral student at the Department of Political
                Science at Lund University. His dissertation, which draws

                awarded the 2017 Research Prize by the Swedish Federation of
                Unemployment Insurance Funds (Arbetslöshetskassornas
                Samorganisation/Sveriges A-Kassor). Since January 2019 he is
                a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Swiss Graduate School of Public
                Administration (IDHEAP) in Lausanne, having held
                a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Bremen International Graduate

                No dataset is ever perfect or complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, and firstly, please do let us know if you spot any
                errors or problems in the materials we provide!
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also some ways in which the data could still be further improved.
                We ourselves are lacking the time and resources to do so,
                but would be more than grateful for input from others interested in
                contributing. We will also provide all the help and assistance we can.
              </p>
              <p>
                Examples of opportunities for further development include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The data could be updated to reflect more recent policy changes.
                  A series of <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1787/2bdfecca-en">
                    OECD studies</a> has already provided updated data for selected
                  years, and these could be used as a starting point.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The coded data on Italy measure availability conditions and
                  sanction rules for the Unemployment Benefit scheme. We have also
                  collected, but not coded yet, qualitative data on the Italian
                  Mobility Allowance and Short-term Work benefit schemes.
                  Any interest in coding these schemes as
                  well would be greatly appreciated.
                </li>

                  The United States are, due to the devolved nature of the U.S.
                  Unemployment Benefit scheme, not covered by this dataset yet.
                  We do, however, have data on State-level rules that are not
                  coded yet, and additional historical information on
                  legislative rules and their changes in U.S. States may also
                  be available from the U.S. Social Security Administration's
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/index.html">

                  We were not able to collect data on any of the countries of
                  Central and Eastern Europe, although they are now commonly
                  included in related data collection projects by the OECD and
                  others (as they should be). Anyone who is interested in
                  contributing historical data on unemployment benefit eligibility
                  rules and sanctions in any of these countries is more than
                  welcome to contact us.
